Working on the Repository
=========================

Work on existing issues
-----------------------

To start, just go in the issue board here_, choose one of interest to you and
add a comment with the text: "take". (without space nor quotation marks, just
the four letters)

Once you did the necessary development to complete the issue, we are happy to
review your pull request and merge your work.


Bug reports
-----------

We are the happiest people if you show us a bug that we somehow introduced in
our codebase. To submit a proper bug report, please provide us with a
comprehensive issue comment allowing us to reproduce the error.

In case the bug can be reproduced in a notebook, a link to a notebook executed
on a tool like Binder_ is perfect.


Enhancements and feature requests
---------------------------------

To suggest enhancement or feature, the usual way is to make an issue. If you
want to discuss with us live, please join us on the next developer's meeting
(see the dedicated page_ with our calendar and its visioconference link).
