Developers' Meetings
====================

We try to make a developer's meeting every two weeks to lead the development of
TimeAtlas. The goal of those meetings is mainly:

- to merge the existing pull requests
- to create some new issues in the backlog
- to assign ourselves issues for the next two weeks

Also, we occasionally discuss about the roadmap.
