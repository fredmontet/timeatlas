Roadmap
=======

2020 - v0.1 - Initial Feature Set
---------------------------------

`GitHub Project <https://github.com/timeatlas-dev/timeatlas/projects/1>`_

**Goals**

* Provide a set of data structures specialised for time series
* Define a standard IO methodss
* Provide a set of methods and plots to handle, process and explore time series
dataset.

2020 - v0.2 - Consolidation
---------------------------

`GitHub Project <https://github.com/timeatlas-dev/timeatlas/projects/5>`_

**Goals**

This project aims at strengthening loading, preprocessing as well as adding a
better visualisation package.

2020 - v0.3 - Modelling, Validation and Detection
-------------------------------------------------

`GitHub Project <https://github.com/timeatlas-dev/timeatlas/projects/3>`_

**Goals**

This project aims at keeping track of the ongoing models and detectors
implementations as well as validation methods. Including :

* a set of models allowing for prediction, classification, clustering
and other machine learning tasks on time series
* standard methods for time series predictions
* a set of methods and plots to validate the quality of a model
* a set of models allowing for anomaly detections


2021 - v0.4 - Editor
--------------------

`GitHub Project <https://github.com/timeatlas-dev/timeatlas/projects/2>`_

**Goals**

This project aims at creating the "Photoshop" of TimeSeries.


2021 - v1.0 - Improve and Publish
---------------------------------

`GitHub Project <https://github.com/timeatlas-dev/timeatlas/projects/4>`_

**Goals**

This project aims at creating publication and reporting tools to share the
results with others. For instance :

* Provide a way to publish models e.g. on Kubernetes,
* using data from BBData to get an API giving you the prediction,
* Allow for retraining of the model from the API.
